FRCommander

Modern, real-time station control & automation for FlexRadio.

FRCommander is a next-generation, cross-platform control and automation application for FlexRadio operators. Works as a companion to SmartSDR or completely stand-alone.
It unifies radio control, rotators, amplifiers, antenna switching, audio routing, CW keying, and smart automation into one fast, modern interface—built for serious operators and modern shacks.
